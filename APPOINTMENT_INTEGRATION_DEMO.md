    ↓
AppointmentService.createAppointment()
    ↓
Stored in unified database with status: PENDING
    ↓
Professional portal loads appointments via AppointmentService.getMyAppointments()
    ↓
Doctor sees pending appointment → Takes action
    ↓
AppointmentService.updateAppointmentStatus()
    ↓
Patient receives notification of changes
```
